# Excellon_Gcode
Excellon_to_Gcode is a Python script to create Gcode from an Excellon file, in this case generated by Eagle.
Excellon file is just a file where you can see the coordinates of all your holes in a PCB,so in this way a GNC machine can drill these holes.
In the repository files there is a manual(in Spanish) that shows how to generate Excellon file in Eagle.
All you have to do is:
#   1. Execute the Excellon_to_Gcode.exe
#   2. Choose your Excellon file
#   3. Choose the destination folder for the Gcode generated files
#   4. Press "ejecutar"
You will see as many Gcode files as drill bits

In the repository files you will find "drills.xln". This file is a short example of a Excellon file with 4 drill bits. Following the previous example
we genrate the 4 Gcode files that you cand find in the repository.
Then, you can introduce, one by one, this Gcode.txt in your CNC machine and see the magic. In my case I had a SRM20 GNC machine, and worked perfectly.

A PCB is not complete without the traces, so I suggest you to use this web I find where you can create traces files so your CNC do all for you
#http://fabmodules.org/
Is a very simple page where you can introduce a black and white image of your PCB, choose your CNC machine, and it will generate the traces files
for you to introduce in your CNC. Afther this, you will have prototyped your PCB in an easy way. 
Please, don't doubt to ask if you have some questions
